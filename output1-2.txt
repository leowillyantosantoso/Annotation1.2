  - Our experiments suggest that gNa and 9E are functions of time and
membrane potential, but that ENa, EK, El, CM and g, may be taken as
constant.
  - In order to decide whether these
effects are sufficient to account for complicated phenomena such as the action
potential and refractory period, it is necessary to obtain expressions relating

  - RNw and RK vary with time and membrane potential; the other components are constant.
  - At a fixed depolarization the sodium current follows a time course whose form is inde-
pendent of the current through the membrane.
  - If the sodium concentration is such that ENaB<E, the sodium current is inward; if it is reduced until
ENa > E the current changes in sign but still appears to follow the same time
course.
  - Since we now know that the sodium current takes an appreciable time to reach its maximum, it is necessary to suppose that there are more carriers and that they react or move more slowly.
  - The proportion of the time that each of the charged molecules spends at the
inside is determined by exp -E/25 so that the proportion of sites at which all
six are at the inside is exp - E/4.17.
  - Details of the mechanism will probably not be settled for some time, but it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the changes in ionic permeability depend on the movement of some component of the membrane which behaves as though it had a large charge or dipole moment.
  - Thus
I = CM d+ i,

MEMBRANE CURRENT IN NERVE
where
I is the total membrane current density (inward current positive);
Ii is the ionic current density (inward current positive);
V is the displacement of the membrane potential from its resting value
(depolarization negative);
CM is the membrane capacity per unit area (assumed constant);
t is time.
  - The justification for this equation is that it is the simplest which can be used
and that it gives values for the membrane capacity which are independent of
the magnitude or sign of V and are little affected by the time course of V (see,
for example, table 1 of Hodgkin et al.
  - (1)) is provided
by the similarity between ionic currents measured with dV= 0 and those

calculated from-CM dt with I= 0 (Hodgkin et al.
  - There is no simple way of
estimating the error introduced by this approximation, but it is not thought
to be large since the time course of the capacitative surge was reasonably close
to that calculated for a perfect condenser (Hodgkin et al.

  - V VgN, VK and VI can
then be measured directly as displacements from the resting potential.
  - The ionic conductances
The discussion in Part I shows that there is little hope of calculating the

At the outset there is the difficulty that both sodium and potassium con-
ductances increase with a delay when the axon is depolarized but fall with no
appreciable infiexion when it is repolarized.
  - The potassium conductance
The formal assumptions used to describe the potassium conductance are:

dn
ddn=n (1-n)-Bnn,

where g
is a constant with the dimensions of conductance/cm2, cx and /n
are rate constants which vary with voltage but not with time and have
dimensions of [time]-', n is a dimensionless variable which can vary between
0 and 1.
  - n represents the proportion ofthe particles in a certain
position (for example at the inside of the membrane) and 1- n represents
the proportion that are somewhere else (for example at the outside of the
membrane).

  - For the purpose of calculation we assume that n=1 at the asymptote which

  - = 20 m.mho/cm2

  - 9E was therefore chosen to be near 24 m.mho/cm2.

derived from these parameters were (in msec-1): o= 021, f,n-
= 070 when
V=0 and ocn= 0 90, fin= 043 when V= -25 mV.
  - In order to find functions connecting Ocn and fiP with membrane potential we
collected all our measurements and plotted them against V, as in Fig.
  - The continuous

from the following expressions:

where an and fin are given in reciprocal msec and V is the displacement of the
membrane potential from its resting value in mV.
  - These expressions should also give a satisfactory formula for the steady
potassium conductance (gK-) at any membrane potential (V), for this relation
is implicit in the measurement of xn and fin.
  - 4 shows that fin is small compared to an over most of the range; we
therefore do not attach much weight to the curve relating fin to V and have
used the simplest expression which gave a reasonable fit.
  - Our equations can therefore be given a qualitative physical
basis if it is supposed that the variation of oc and fi with membrane potential
arises from the effect of the;; electric field on the movement of a negatively
charged particle which rests on the outside of the membrane when V is large
and positive, and on the inside when it is large and negative.

  - It is then found that V goes off towards either + oo or -oo,
according as the guessed 0 was too small or too large.
  - The correct value brings
V back to zero (the resting condition) when the action potential is over.
  - We suspect that a system which tends to - c

all values of 0 after an initial negative displacement of V is one which is
incapable of propagating an action potential.

The subsidiary equations (7), (15) and (16), and the a's and ,'s, are the same as for the membrane
equation.
  - In practice it is necessary to start with V deviating from zero by a finite
amount (0.1 mV was used).
  - The first few values of V, and hence the differences, were obtained as
follows.
  - The solution of this equation is V = VoeMt,
where ,

When K has been chosen, ju can thus be found and hence V1, V., etc.
  - After several runs had been calculated, so that K was known within fairly narrow limits, time
was saved by starting new runs not from near V = 0 but from a set of values interpolated between
corresponding points on a run which had gone towards + oo and another which had gone
towards - o.
  - From
these it was possible to derive an estimate of the values (denoted by z) that d2 V/dt2 would have
taken in a propagated action potential.

This was repeated until the z's assumed for a particular run agreed with the d2V/dt2's derived
from the same run.
  - In this and all subsequent
figures depolarizations (or negative displacements of V) are plotted upwards.

displacement in time.
  - It will be seen that the general agreement is
good, as regards amplitude, form and time-scale.

  - The
broken curve shows the membrane action potential in mV; the continuous curve shows the
total membrane conductance (gN +g9 +9) as a function of time.
  - The time scales are the same in A and B.
  - The time scale is the same inBas inA,
and the curves have been drawn with the same peak height.
  - Thus (1) the main rise in conductance begins later than the rise of
potential; (2) the conductance does not fall to its resting value until late in
the positive phase; and (3) the peak of the conductance change occurs at
nearly the same time as the peak of potential.
  - The exact time relation between
the peaks depends on the conditions, as can be seen from Table 4.
  - These authors found that the average membrane resistance at the peak of
the impedance change was 25 Q.cm2, corresponding to a conductance of
40 m.mho/cm2.
  - The peak conductances in our calculated action potentials
ranged from 31 to 53 m.mho/cm2 according to the conditions, as shown in
Table 4.

  - Ionic movements
Time course ofionic currents.
  - The time course ofthe components ofmembrane
current carried by sodium and potassium ions during the calculated pro-
pagated spike is shown in Fig.
  - The
magnitudes of these two terms during steady propagation are-CCMdV/dt and
(Cm/K) d2V/dt2 respectively, and the manner in which the ionic current is
divided between them at the different stages of the spike is shown in Fig.
  - Thus the outward
flux of sodium ions is INa/(exp (VV-Na) F/RT- 1), and the inward flux of
potassium ions is -IK/(exp (VK- V) FIRT -1).
  - Refractory period
Time course of inactivation and delayed rectification.
  - According to our theory,
there are two changes resulting from the depolarization during a spike which
make the membrane unable to respond to another stimulus until a certain
time has elapsed.
  - These are 'inactivation', which reduces the level to which

suddenly stopped after passing for a time long compared with all the time-
constants of the membrane.
  - (26) was solved with I = 0 and the
initial conditions that V= + 30 mV, and m, n and h have their steady state
values for V = + 30 mV, when t =0.
  - The numbers attached to the curves give the

  - B, response of nerve membrane at 60C to short shocks; the numbers show the charge applied

  - The curves have been replotted from records taken at low amplification
and a relatively high time-base speed.
  - A spike resulted, and the time course of membrane potential is
plotted in Fig.
  - These effects persist for
an appreciable time so that the membrane potential reaches its resting value
with a reduced outward potassium current and an increased inward sodium
current.
  - The total ionic current is therefore inward at V =0 and the membrane
undergoes a depolarization which rapidly becomes regenerative.
